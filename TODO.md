# Buddha.js - Planned Improvements

This TODO list tracks planned features and improvements, inspired by the practical "plain and simple" approach to Buddhist philosophy.

## "Plain and Simple" API Enhancements
- [x] **English Aliases**: Add readable aliases for Sanskrit terms to make the library more accessible (e.g., `Dissatisfaction` for `Dukkha`, `Confusion` for `Avidya`).
- [ ] **The "84th Problem" Helper**: Create a utility to distinguish between inevitable pain (first arrow) and the suffering of resistance (second arrow).
- [ ] **"Poison Arrow" Simulation**: A simplified simulation mode that focuses strictly on immediate cessation of suffering without requiring deep configuration of the 12 Nidanas.

## Core Features
- [ ] **Meditation Timer**: Implement a real-time meditation timer that tracks "mindful moments" (checking in) versus distraction.
- [ ] **Koan Generator**: A class that presents paradoxical logic puzzles to break out of dualistic thinking/conditional logic.
- [ ] **Refactoring**: Simplify `Being.ts` to be more compositional and less monolithic.

## Documentation
- [ ] **Metaphor Guide**: A doc explaining key concepts using the "Raft", "Finger pointing at the Moon", and "House on Fire" metaphors.
- [ ] **Interactive Tutorial**: A step-by-step code tutorial building a "Mind" from scratch.
