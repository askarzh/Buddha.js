# Buddha.js Documentation

Conceptual documentation exploring the intersection of Buddhist philosophy and TypeScript programming patterns.

## Documents

### [Typed Dependency Graph](./typed-dependency-graph.md)

How the 12 nidanas (pratityasamutpada) can be modeled as a compile-time typed dependency graph using TypeScript generics.

**Topics:**
- Type-level chain definition
- Position-to-type mapping
- Compile-time predecessor/successor types
- Temporal groupings (three-life interpretation)
- Alternative models (momentary, cyclic)

### [Momentariness and Reactive Programming](./momentariness-reactive-programming.md)

A comparative analysis of Kṣaṇikavāda (doctrine of momentariness) and reactive programming paradigms (RxJS).

**Topics:**
- Kṣaṇa (moment) as discrete emission
- Santāna (continuum) as Observable stream
- Dependent origination as operator pipelines
- Mindfulness as stream interception
- Nirvāṇa as stream completion

### [Vipassanā as Object Observation](./vipassana-object-observation.md)

Implementing Vipassanā (insight meditation) as a function for non-reactive state observation.

**Topics:**
- Four Foundations applied to objects
- Noting practice (precise, bare, choiceless)
- Examining the Three Marks (anicca, dukkha, anatta)
- Body scan, rising/falling, choiceless awareness
- The mindful proxy pattern

### [Metaphor Guide: Raft, Finger, and Burning House](./metaphor-guide.md)

Three classic Buddhist metaphors applied to the library: when to use the tools, what they point toward, and why simplicity matters.

**Topics:**
- The Raft (Kullupama Sutta) — tools for crossing, not for carrying
- The Finger Pointing at the Moon — conventional truth vs ultimate truth
- The House on Fire (Lotus Sutra) — skillful means and the PoisonArrow

## Philosophical Foundation

These documents explore how Buddhist phenomenology maps to computational concepts:

| Buddhist Concept | Programming Pattern |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Dependent Origination | Typed dependency graphs |
| Momentariness | Reactive streams / immutable events |
| Mindfulness | Non-reactive observation / Proxy |
| Three Marks | Property analysis functions |
| Liberation | Stream completion / unsubscription |
| Skillful Means (Upaya) | Simplified APIs / CLI wrappers |

## Usage

These documents serve as:
1. **Design references** for extending Buddha.js
2. **Conceptual bridges** between Buddhist philosophy and programming
3. **Implementation guides** for advanced patterns
