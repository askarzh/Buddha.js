# Chain — Dependent Origination (Pratityasamutpada)

Display the 12 links of dependent origination, the causal chain that describes how suffering arises and how it can be broken.

## Instructions

1. Run the chain command:

```bash
node dist/cli.mjs chain --json
```

2. Present the 12 links (nidanas) from the JSON output:
   1. **Ignorance** (Avidya)
   2. **Formations** (Samskara)
   3. **Consciousness** (Vijnana)
   4. **Name-and-Form** (Namarupa)
   5. **Six Sense Bases** (Sadayatana)
   6. **Contact** (Sparsha)
   7. **Feeling** (Vedana)
   8. **Craving** (Trishna)
   9. **Clinging** (Upadana)
   10. **Becoming** (Bhava)
   11. **Birth** (Jati)
   12. **Aging-and-Death** (Jaramarana)

3. Highlight the **liberation point**: the link between Feeling and Craving (links 7-8) is where the chain can be broken through mindfulness. When feeling arises, one can choose not to react with craving.

4. Show the connections between links — each arises dependent on the previous one. This is not a linear timeline but a description of how experience is constructed moment to moment.
