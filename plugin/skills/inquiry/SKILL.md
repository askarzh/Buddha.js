# Self-Inquiry (Anatta Investigation)

Investigate the nature of self through the Buddha.js anatta (not-self) analysis. This examines the five aggregates, dependent origination, and emptiness to reveal the constructed nature of identity.

## Instructions

1. Run the inquiry command:

```bash
node dist/cli.mjs inquiry --json --being default
```

2. Parse the JSON output and present the investigation results:
   - **Aggregate Search**: Walk through each of the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) showing that none is a fixed self
   - **Dependent Origination Insight**: How the sense of self arises through conditions
   - **Emptiness Analysis**: The three natures examination (imagined, dependent, perfected)
   - **Conclusion**: The teaching that emerges from the investigation

3. **Important**: This command modifies the being's state. The investigation itself is a transformative practice that affects mindfulness and insight levels.

4. Present the results contemplatively — this is a meditative investigation, not just data retrieval.
