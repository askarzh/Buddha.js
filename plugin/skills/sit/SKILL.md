# Sit — Guided Cessation (Poison Arrow Method)

Guide the user through the Poison Arrow method for cessation of suffering. The Buddha taught that when struck by an arrow, the wise person removes it immediately rather than asking who shot it, what it was made of, etc.

## Instructions

1. If the user describes a specific suffering or situation, use it directly. Otherwise, ask them briefly what is troubling them.

2. Run the sit command:

```bash
node dist/cli.mjs sit --json --situation "description of the suffering or problem"
```

3. Present the cessation steps from the JSON output:
   - **Recognition**: Acknowledging what is present
   - **The Arrow**: Identifying the immediate suffering (not its story)
   - **Removal**: The direct letting-go, the cessation practice
   - **Relief**: What opens up when the arrow is removed

4. Keep the presentation gentle and spacious. This is a contemplative practice, not a debugging session. Allow pauses in the guidance.

5. The Poison Arrow parable teaches: don't get lost in analysis of why you suffer — attend to the suffering directly and let it go.
